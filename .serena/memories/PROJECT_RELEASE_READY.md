Release readiness audit passed. Resource handling: QSettings (MainWindow uses parented instance; SettingsManager syncs+deletes), QFile for QSS read is scoped/closed, QProcess terminated on close/destructor/timeout paths. Environment isolation: release package includes python_runtime/ and app resolves embedded runtime first; build script copies runtime when present; verify_python.bat exists. QSS injection: theme name is whitelisted and QSS loaded from embedded resources only; no external CSS input path.
